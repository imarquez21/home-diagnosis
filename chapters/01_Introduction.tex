\section{Introduction}\label{Introduction}


Networks today have evolved significantly, one of the most tangible examples of this evolution are Wireless Networks. The most used type of Wireless Networks at home are WLANs, properly defined under the 802.11 protocol. Most users at home access Internet using their home WLANs. The variety of services and devices using the home WLAN to access Internet is vast. It is common today for a home user to stream a movie on his laptop via home WLAN. In the ideal case scenario the experience is enjoyable. In many cases, when the movie streaming is degraded, the experience is frustrating to the user. One of the potential causes of poor streaming experience is the home WLAN. In fact, previous works \cite{homeoraccesslink} have identified home WLANs as the bottleneck along the path of an Internet service. The cause of poor Home WLAN experience can be varied, as described in previous work \cite{wislow}, channel congestion, poor client or AP placement and interference are the most common causes. Other works \cite{wifi_weakest_link} have analyzed the impact of Home WLAN on latency along a network path. They have identified that WiFi hops latency can contribute up to 60\% of the overall round trip time along the service path. On top of these technical causes, a business-relationship risk arises. A risk between home users, ISPs and content providers. As described in previous works \cite{predicting_effect_Home_Wifi} the frustration is not only experienced by the users but also by users' ISPs who are often held responsible for poor Internet experience. This problem might seem small, nevertheless it can escalate until a point in which content providers lose their subscribers. Home users, in the search of a solution can switch between ISPs, if complication persists they can even switch content providers. In this context ISPs and content providers have little to none impact on the root cause of the degraded experience, the home WLAN. Under this light lies our motivation to develop a tool to identify Wireless impairments in Home WLANs. The description of the initial stages of this tool are presented along this paper. Identifying where the root cause is within the Home WLAN is challenging due to multiple factors. To begin with Wireless nature is unreliable as it uses an open and shared medium, shared among WiFi and non-WiFi devices. Another factor is the measurement technique to use to find where the problem is located. At the time of this paper and to the best of our knowledge most research works have mainly implemented passive techniques \cite{hostview} \cite{passive_wifi_capacity_estimation}. A couple others have relied upon active techniques \cite{can_user_level_probing}. Depending on the type of technique implemented challenges can be presented. Passive techniques are usually tied to the challenge of having access to the device collecting the metrics. With active techniques the complication can be adding overhead by introducing mechanisms to obtain network metrics. In other words, with active metrics the very same measurement instrument can bias the measuring results. Our tool implements a mixture of both to take strong points of both and leverage the weakness with each other's strong points. Further description of these techniques along with related work associated to home WLAN study will be covered in section \ref{Back_Related_Work}. The instrumentation details of our tool are developed in section \ref{Wireless Bottleneck Detector}. The mechanisms and techniques to evaluate our method to identify impairments in Home WLANs is explained in section \ref{Evaluation_Method}. Findings of our work are consolidated in section \ref{Results}.
