\section{Results}\label{Results}

In the closing section we summarize what we have achieved, similar to what we have discussed at the closing of the previous section, \ref{Evaluation_Method}.

Based on the tool and the methodology we used we outline the results we obtained.

What are our results telling us?

Can we identify impairments from the chosen metrics?

Which of the two methods, active or passive, can be considered to best suit the detection of Wireless impairments?

Why is the chosen method more suitable?

Future Work can be mentioned to describe the integration of this work with the project with Princeton.
