Home WLANs have become an essential element in households nowadays. The preferred method to access Internet from home is WiFi, Home WLANs. Home WLANs have brought their benefits and challenges into the home. The variety and complexity of WiFi and non-WiFi devices make Home WLANs keen to experience impairments. These impairments can be complex to identify even by Wireless experts. In this paper we present our tool which's main goal is to help to identify Wireless impairments by relying on active and passive measurement techniques. Our tool collects wireless metrics from the Wireless client and AP to get a sense on how each of these devices perceive the environment. Along the Wireless metrics collection, we actively collect bandwidth and RTT metrics. Both metric types are collected during different environment conditions which we have instrumented in the Wireless test bed for this work. Finally we correlate passively collected metrics with active ones to help to identify when a Wireless complication is present.
