In this section we tell the story of why are we working to address the question related to Wireless impairments.

The main goal is to be able to identify Wireless Impairment in the Home Wireless.

Why? - Because most of the times the bottle neck in an end-to-end communication tends to be the Home Wireless.

Users gets frustrated as they do not know how to approach the problem. In fact, even with wireless networks knowledge identifying the root cause can be challenging.

Our work will become part of a tool which strives to identify where the bottleneck in and end-to-end communication is. The tool is already deployed in the wild.
