\section{Background and Related Work}\label{Back_Related_Work}

In this section we present a \emph{high level overview} of what has been done before with regards to Wireless conditions measurements.

We refer to literature and mention the methods and metrics collected from those methods to predict, infer or asses Wireless conditions.

\subsection{Wireless Monitoring Metrics}

Here we list the metrics found in literature and list them under the two families, active and passive.

\subsection*{Active}

\begin{itemize}
	\item One-Way Delay
	\item Round Trip Time
	\item More
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Passive}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Rate
	\item RSSI
	\item More
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Where do we collect them?}

We list the different vantage points from where the metrics have been collected. We can also include the accuracy.

Note - From what I recall most of metrics have been collected from APs, which means we need to have access to the AP.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Station
	\item Access Point
	\item Server
\end{itemize}
