\section{Introduction}\label{Introduction}


Computer networks have evolved significantly in the last years resulting in different services available almost everywhere. One of the most tangible results are Wireless Networks which play an important role in several contexts; whether if in offices, stores or homes. The fast-paced  evolution Wireless has had in the last years have allow it to make its way into homes, bringing with it, its advantages and challenges. In one of the most common scenarios of wireless at home, the user with his connected device streams a video or plays online; suddenly the video stops or the online game "lag" or disconnects. The user, completing ignoring what can be the cause gets frustrated and calls his ISP seeking for assistance \emph{as he has a high bandwidth Internet access with it} . In this scope ISPs have limited or zero-visibility of what is happening inside the home Wireless Network. ISPs scope is limited to assist beyond the last-mile to which they have access to. Finally both, users and ISPs, get stuck in a loop as they both have face a limitation to find the cause of the issue.


\textbf{Main Ideas for the Introduction - Tell a Story}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Networks have evolved significantly.
	\item Wireless Networks are tangible evidence of it.
	\item Wireless Networks are available almost everywhere.
	\item Wireless has made its way into homes, bringing its benefits and challenges.
	\item Wireless Networks are complex because Wireless nature is unstable, is a share medium.
	\item Even Wireless experts face challenges while troubleshooting issues.
	\item User watches a video or plays on his Wireless devices and suddenly the video or application stops.
	\item Users gets angry as he does not know what can be causing it.
	\item The first reaction is to call their ISP seeking for a solution.
	\item ISP check his side, settings are in order from his end.
	\item Users states that there is clearly a problem and he wants help as he is paying for a good service.
	\item ISP has limited view into what can be the cause inside the Home Networks.
	\item Both ends get "stressed" as they both face limitations.
	\item Users lack knowledge and tools to help him confirm his Home Wireless is the problem or not.
	\item User, in the other hand, has access to the home Wireless Network.
	\item ISP lack the visibility and tools to troubleshoot user's Home Wireless.
	\item ISP, in the other hand, has the knowledge to identify what based on metrics if the Wireless Networks is the cause of the problem.
	\item As a final result User might end up switching ISP or content provider.
	\item Switching ISP or content provider would not be a final fix as they root cause can be located in the Home Wireless.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Motivation - Why do we want to create a Detector}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item To assist users to confirm if home Wireless is the root cause or not
	\item To help ISP to have tools to identify if the home Wireless is the problem
	\item To have a tool which provides evidence that there is a problem in the Home Wireless
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Outcomes from creating the detector}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item To assist users to confirm if home Wireless is the root cause or not
	\item If the tool provides evidence home Wireless i not the root cause they can go to their ISP and ask for assistance.
	\item To help ISP to have tools to identify if the home Wireless is the problem
	\item If the ISPs have the evidence Wireless is the problem, then they can instruct user that the root cause is within the Home Wireless.
\end{enumerate}


In this section we tell the story of why are we working to address the question related to Wireless impairments.

The main goal is to be able to identify Wireless Impairment in the Home Wireless.

Why? - Because most of the times the bottle neck in an end-to-end communication tends to be the Home Wireless.

Users gets frustrated as they do not know how to approach the problem. In fact, even with wireless networks knowledge identifying the root cause can be challenging.

Our work will become part of a tool which strives to identify where the bottleneck in and end-to-end communication is. The tool is already deployed in the wild.
